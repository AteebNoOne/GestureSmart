# GestureSmart: Comprehensive Documentation

## System vs. Framework

**GestureSmart is a system**, not just a framework. While it utilizes various frameworks in its implementation, it constitutes a complete end-to-end system for gesture recognition and device control.

**If someone asks how it's a system:**
GestureSmart qualifies as a system because it integrates multiple components (gesture detection, voice recognition, user interface) into a cohesive whole that functions independently to solve a specific problem. It processes inputs (gestures/voice), performs complex operations (recognition/interpretation), and produces outputs (device control actions). Unlike a framework which provides tools for developers to build applications, GestureSmart is a fully functional application system that end-users can directly interact with to control their devices through gestures.

## Methodologies Used

1. **Computer Vision-based Gesture Recognition**: Using TensorFlow.js and MediaPipe models to detect and track hand movements in real-time.
2. **Machine Learning for Gesture Classification**: Employing pre-trained models that are optimized for mobile devices.
3. **Real-time Processing**: Continuous frame-by-frame analysis for immediate gesture detection and response.
4. **Background Processing**: Service architecture that allows gesture detection to continue running in the background.
5. **Local Processing**: On-device computation to ensure privacy and reduce latency.
6. **Reactive Programming**: Event-driven architecture to respond to detected gestures.
7. **Responsive Design**: Adapting to different device sizes and orientations.
8. **Modular Development**: Separation of concerns between detection, interpretation, and action execution.
